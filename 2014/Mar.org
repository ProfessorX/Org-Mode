   - Life is full of ups and downs. And if you do not work hard
     enough, you shall get fucked off by Masdar Institute.
   - [ ] Finish the arduino part of Lab3-3.
   - [ ] Finish the second project of machine learning.
   - [ ] Attend the tutorial in the day (I bet it has something to do
     with Midterm) and please do not fuck the second half (which would
     save you from disaster!)

     In short, finish what you have promised after your wake-up and go
     to bed, get up as early as possible.
