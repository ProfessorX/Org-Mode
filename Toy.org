   My favorite sentences are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim[fn:1]
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king.
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miradan Otto.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo.
   - Sean :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.
